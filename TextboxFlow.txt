Text file containing dialogue and cutscene directions

Cutscene manager takes this text file, reads through it, and enqueues the proper cutscene and dialogue box events.


CURRENTLY:
TB_Event creates the textbox and TB_State

TB_State sets the textbox message, opens it, and starts typing

Each textbox should get a queue of lines to run through before it finishes
Each DialogueBox should get a queue of lines along with a character name


INSTEAD:
TB_Event creates TB_State, passes it array of lines + other data

TB_State enter() creates the Textbox and passes it the array of lines + other data

Textbox on instantiation takes:
- Spawn position, dimensions
- The lines it is going to run through. Starts typing first line.

TB_State watches for spacebar press. If so, lets Textbox know to continue.

Textbox checks after each line if it is the last line in the queue.
- If so, destroys itself and runs StateStack.resumeState()
- If not, sets the next line and runs typeText()

TB_State checks in resumeState() if the textbox is null. If so, exit state.
